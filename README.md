Building an Autonomous Navigation System for a Rover

This repository contains the code and documentation for developing an autonomous navigation system for a rover. The primary objective is to enable the rover to navigate autonomously in challenging terrains, avoid obstacles, and achieve target locations efficiently.

Features

Obstacle detection and avoidance

Path planning using reinforcement learning (Soft Actor-Critic algorithm)

Real-time sensor data processing

Martian surface simulation for testing and validation

Safe landing spot identification for drones

Return-to-home functionality

Project Overview

This project aims to create an indigenous algorithm for:

Self-contained navigation of a rover.

Identifying safe spots for landing on Martian-like surfaces.

Returning to the home position after completing the mission.

Key Components

Sensors: Used for terrain mapping and obstacle detection.

Control Systems: Autonomous decision-making for navigation and avoidance.

Machine Learning: Reinforcement learning for dynamic path optimization.

Simulations: Testing in simulated Martian environments.
